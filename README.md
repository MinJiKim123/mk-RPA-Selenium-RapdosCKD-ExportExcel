# mk-RPA-Selenium-RapdosCKD-ExportExcel

## About this project
* Automates web process to export data to excel sheets for 5+ companies 
* Input values are configured in XML file _config.xml_
* Utilize Chromedriver, edgedrvier
* Results are automatically saved in C:/RAPDOSEXL

## What needs to be improved
* Since web elements can be changed or updated, configuring the elements seperately in xml file rather than hard coding them, could be a good solution
* When Chrome or Edge updates, the corresponding executable driver should also be manually updated. Automating this process will improve the maintenance of this application
